## UML Class Diagram of Models
![Updated UML](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5bcef09d-81ad-4e6c-9b9a-0166031fec9d)

The UML diagram illustrates the relationships between models, such as User, Application, Event, and ProfProfile. This provides an overview of the system's structure and the mapping to the database schema.

## Database Schema (Generated by ORM)

The following SQL schema was generated by the ORM (Hibernate) based on the models in our application. It illustrates the table structures, fields, and relationships between entities.

```sql
create table applications (
    applicationuid bigint not null,
    eventuid bigint,
    useruid bigint,
    cvf varchar(255),
    desprof varchar(255),
    diplomaf varchar(255),
    gradeauditf varchar(255),
    profcomment varchar(255),
    stdfields varchar(255),
    primary key (applicationuid)
) engine=InnoDB;

create table events (
    eventuid bigint not null,
    initdate datetime(6),
    description varchar(255),
    title varchar(255),
    primary key (eventuid)
) engine=InnoDB;

create table profprofiles (
    profprofileuid bigint not null,
    eventuid bigint,
    profuid bigint,
    assignedstduidlist varchar(255),
    finalstdlist varchar(255),
    info varchar(255),
    research varchar(255),
    primary key (profprofileuid)
) engine=InnoDB;

create table users (
    useruid bigint not null,
    usertype varchar(31) not null,
    email varchar(255),
    username varchar(255),
    userpassword varchar(255),
    primary key (useruid)
) engine=InnoDB;
